        This album is so beautifully complex, yet also very simple in many
        ways. The production by Sounwave, Thundercat, Pharell and many more,
        is second to none. Lamar talks aboutso many relevant topics,
        insitutionalization, self hate, the African-American communities views
        oncomplexion, all tied together beautifully with an ever growing poem
        at the tailend of most songs.

      <section class="description">
        One of my favorite sonically sounding albums, the beautiful synth
        beats by Taborello with their flickering notes and warm fun sound
        along withGibbard's delicate vocals and heartbreaking lyrics about
        loss are unmatched. The songtopics are all phenominal, The District
        Sleeps Alone Tonight about a breakup and tryingto deal with the change
        and the circumstances of the breakup, Such Great Heights talkingu
        about how relationships cause you to not care about everyone else and
        Brand New Colony speaking about the feeling of wanting to do
        everything for someone you love.

      <section class="description">
        Jeff Mangum, the lead-singer and guitar player for Neutral Milk Hotel,
        writes bizzarre and cryptic lyrics about Anne Frank, Stories of WWII,
        Adultery and depression on this album with an equally eclectic sound
        to match. Blown out fuzzy guitars, Mangum's odd singing voice all add
        up to one of the most unique albums.
