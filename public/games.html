        The Binding of Isaac is a rouge-like video game made by Edmund
        McMillen initially released in 2011. It is very fun and has pretty
        much infinite replayability. It's a game very much based on collecting
        items and seeing how they react when put together, or at least that's
        why I love it. It's very fun to over power the game and steam roll
        every enemy and boss. It has so much content it is ridiculous, I love
        this game dearly.

        This game is such a delight, great music, engaging music and is a very
        satisfying collect-a-thon. This game has the type of grinding I like
        in video game. Grinding bosses until you can beat them without a
        thougth is one of the most satisfying things and the progression adds
        a similar experience.

        One of my favorite multiplayer fps ever. I love movement and dense,
        skill based movement mechanics such as bunny hopping, grenade boosting
        etc. and this game is full of it.

        A beautiful serence expereince, such a relaxing game which just
        exemplifies the expereince of getting away from city life, and the
        hustle and bustle of it all. Made entirely by Eric Barone,a UW Tacoma
        CS graduate actually. A beautiful experience which is completely
        unstressful and so much fun
